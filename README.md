# -Deloitte-virtual-Internship-Forage

Task 1

We have signed a new account - Daikibo Industrials, a global leader in the manufacturing of heavy machinery, founded and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. They needed assistance with a variety of problems and were impressed to find out Deloitte could help in all verticals.

Daikibo is in the process of integrating IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to monitor, measure and analyze their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure uses devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half - in another. They need your help to combine the two.

Task is to get acquainted with the 2 data formats by exploring the files and explore the target unified format by looking at the json file.
